Step by step guide to becoming a modern backend developer

## Internet

### How does the internet work?

> The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

### What is HTTP?

> HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

### Browser and how it works?

> A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.

### DNS and how it works?

> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

### What is the Domain Name System?

> A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.

### What is a Hosting?

> Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

## Learn a Language

### What is a programming language?

> A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

### Python

> Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

## Version Control

### What is Version Control?

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Git

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
